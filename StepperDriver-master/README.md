StepperDriver
=============

A4988, DRV8825, DRV8834, DRV8880 and generic two-pin stepper motor driver library.
Features:
   - Constant speed mode (low rpms)
   - Linear (accelerated) speed mode, with separate acceleration and deceleration settings.
   - Non-blocking mode (yields back to caller after each pulse)
   - Early brake / increase runtime in non-blocking mode

Wiring
======

This is suggested wiring for running the examples unmodified. All the pins below can be changed.

- Arduino to driver board:
    - DIR - D8
    - STEP - D9
    - SLEEP - HIGH (Vdd)
    - GND - Arduino GND
    - GND - Motor power GND
    - VMOT - Motor power (check driver-specific voltage range)
    - A4988/DRV8825 microstep control
      - MS1/MODE0 - D10
      - MS2/MODE1 - D11
      - MS3/MODE2 - D12
    - DRV8834/DRV8880 microstep control
      - M0 - D10
      - M1 - D11
    - ~ENABLE (optional) recommend D13 to see when coils are active

- driver board to motor (this varies from motor to motor, check motor coils schematic).
- 100uF capacitor between GND - VMOT 
- Make sure to set the max current on the driver board to the motor limit (see below).
- Have a motor power supply that can deliver that current.
- Make sure the motor power supply voltage is within the range supported by the driver board.

Set Max Current
===============

The max current is set via the potentiometer on board.
Turn it while measuring voltage at the passthrough next to it.
The formula is V = I*5*R where I=max current, R=current sense resistor installed onboard

- DRV8834 Pololu board, R=0.1 and V = 0.5 * max current(A). 
  For example, for 1A you will set it to 0.5V.

- DRV8825 low-current board, R=0.33 and V = 1.65 * max current(A).
  For example, for 0.5A the reference voltage should be 0.82V

For latest info, see the Pololu board information pages.

Code
====

See the BasicStepperDriver example for a generic driver that should work with any board
supporting the DIR/STEP indexing mode.

The Microstepping example works with a DRV8834 board.

For example, to show what is possible, here is the ClockStepper example that moves a 
stepper motor like the seconds hand of a watch:

```C++
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "A4988.h"

// using a 200-step motor (most common)
#define MOTOR_STEPS 200
// configure the pins connected
#define DIR 8
#define STEP 9
#define MS1 10
#define MS2 11
#define MS3 12
A4988 stepper(MOTOR_STEPS, DIR, STEP, MS1, MS2, MS3);

void setup() {
    // Set target motor RPM to 1RPM and microstepping to 1 (full step mode)
    stepper.begin(1, 1);
}

void loop() {
    // Tell motor to rotate 360 degrees. That's it.
    stepper.rotate(360);
}
```
